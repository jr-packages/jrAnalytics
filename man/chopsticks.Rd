\description{
A few researchers set out to determine the optimal length
of chopsticks for children and adults. They came up with a measure of
how effective a pair of chopsticks performed, called the "Food Pinching
Performance". The "Food Pinching Performance" was determined by
counting the number of peanuts picked and placed in a cup (PPPC).

The idea was taken from http://blog.yhat.com/posts/7-funny-datasets.html
